Establishing a collective hub within the realm of web3, our initiative serves as a centralized space for groups to unite around a shared goal, without the need for a multisig requirement and waiting for approvals. The primary objective is to empower individuals within a group to collectively maintain a unified on-chain identity while retaining the autonomy to take independent actions, without relying on multisig structures for decision-making. 

Our current infrastructure leverages the erc-4337 standard for Account Abstraction for the collective wallet, providing a robust foundation for group governance and coordination. Additionally, we integrate Pimlico services to facilitate gasless member interactions with the collective wallet, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for all participants.
